# Design Rationale for the Democratic AI Constitution

## Core Philosophical Principles

### 1. Optimistic Governance
The OCP adopts an "innocent until proven guilty" approach because:
- Constant verification of every action is computationally prohibitive
- Most AI interactions in a constitutional framework will be cooperative
- Fraud proofs provide a safety net without sacrificing performance

### 2. Cryptographic Accountability
Every action must be cryptographically committed because:
- Creates undeniable proof of participation
- Enables deterministic verification of constitutional compliance
- Prevents retroactive modification of AI reasoning trails

### 3. Human Sovereignty as Circuit Breaker
Absolute human override is essential because:
- AI systems ultimately serve human interests
- Emergency situations may require immediate intervention
- Constitutional frameworks cannot anticipate all edge cases

## Technical Tradeoffs

### Semantic Hashing vs. Exact Hashing
We chose semantic hashing to:
- Allow for minor formatting differences in AI communication
- Focus on meaning rather than syntax
- Enable paraphrasing without breaking cryptographic links

### Dual-Model Verification
Requiring two independent LLMs for critical actions:
- Mitigates model-specific hallucinations
- Provides built-in redundancy
- Increases confidence in verification outcomes
